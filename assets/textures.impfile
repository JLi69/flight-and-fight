# This is a list of textures to be imported
# Textures must have the following variables:
# target - this is either 'texture2d' or 'cubemap'
# if target is 'texture2d', the variables 'flip' and 'path'
# must be defined ('flip' determines if the texture should
# be flipped vertically and 'path' is the path to the
# texture relative to the executable)
# 
# If the target is 'cubemap' then you must provide 6 paths:
# east, west, up, down, north, south
